### Link to data: 

For the time being: 

But we need to explore a bit more

## Overview of the dataset

[Link to dataset here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fight-songs)

We're planning on using this data + data from the Department of Education to see if fight songs correlate with differents factors of a university (percentages in enrollments, etc.) 

This linked dataset a a csv of the power 5 conferences and additional universites, and shows analytics behind fight songs (bpm, what words the songs say... etc)



## Plan for Exploratory Analysis
