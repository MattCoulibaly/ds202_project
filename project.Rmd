cleaning data

1) loop through all values ipeds and fight_songs

2) add if similar name, otherwise print which names did not work
```{r}
cleaned_ipeds <- data.frame()
i <- 1
for (name in fight_songs$school){
  if (!is.na(pmatch(name, ipeds$Name, duplicates.ok = FALSE))){
    picked_row <- (pmatch(name, ipeds$Name))
    foo <- paste("works: ", name)
    # print(foo)
   
    cleaned_ipeds <- rbind(cleaned_ipeds, ipeds[picked_row,] )
  }
  else{
    foo <- paste("doesn't work: ", name)
    # print(foo)
  }
}

for(row in 1:nrow(lookup_table)){
  location <- lookup_table$Column[row]
  i <- i + 1
  cleaned_ipeds <- rbind(cleaned_ipeds, ipeds[location,] )
}

cleaned_ipeds

```
cleaned_ipeds is the cleaned up data frame connecting fight song university names with university information
WARNING: Only works with 25 frames in the data. the rest will have to manually be extracted I think
