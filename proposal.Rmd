## Overview of the dataset

For the time being: 

[Link to dataset here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fight-songs)

We're planning on using this data + data from the Department of Education to see if fight songs correlate with differents factors of a university (percentages in enrollments, etc.) 

This linked dataset a a csv of the power 5 conferences and additional universites, and shows analytics behind fight songs (bpm, what words the songs say... etc)



## Plan for Exploratory Analysis

1. Look into data from the Department of Education

2. Look into potential sports statistics/wins and loses 

3. Look into songs for each potential sports conference

4. Time series... Year when written... Potential correlations (win rates...) 

5. Compare fight songs written by students vs not written by students
